Park Alert
============

*Ever had the problem of parking your car and then forgetting to go back and place coins in the meter to avoid fines?*

Well, everyone has that problem.

The idea of this prototype infrastructure is to have:
 * An Android app where users subscribe their parking location and notify the presence of possible workers about to fine a car.
 * A web-based application that replicates all that behaviour.
 * A backend exposing a REST API that is used by both web and Android-based apps.
